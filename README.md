🚀 Vote Calculator Web App – Built with Django 🗳

I recently developed a Vote Calculator project using Django, implementing URL mapping and HTTP POST methods for efficient request handling. This project processes user inputs dynamically and displays real-time vote calculations.

🔹 Tech Stack: Django | Python | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap
🔹 Key Features:
✅ Secure form handling with CSRF protection
✅ Dynamic vote calculations with real-time output
✅ User-friendly UI with a clean and responsive design
✅ Efficient backend logic using Django views

This project helped me enhance my skills in Django request handling, form validation, and frontend-backend integration. Excited to continue building more interactive web applications! 🚀

Would love to hear your thoughts! 🤝
